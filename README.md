# The Awesome Number Adder Challenge ðŸ”¢âž•ðŸ”¢

## Your Mission:

Your mission, is to write a C program that acts like a mini-calculator. Here's how it will work:

**1. The Power of Input:** Users will type in two numbers and a plus sign, just like this: 5 + 3

**2. Your C Magic:** Your program will swoop in, grab those numbers, and perform a super-fast addition calculation!

**3. The Grand Output:** It will proudly display the answer (in this case, 8) on the screen.

# Skills You'll Level Up:

**Input & Output:** Master the art of taking information from the user and displaying results.

**Variables:** Learn how to store numbers like a pro.

**Operators:** The awesome plus sign (+) will be your best friend.

**C Fundamentals:** Get a solid grip on the basics of C programming.

**Error Handling:** Make your program bulletproof! What if someone types letters instead of numbers? Handle those errors gracefully.
